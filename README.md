[![Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/master/designs/thumbnail.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/master/designs/page.jpg)

### Instructions
For this challenge, you will need to build a simple webpage. This is intended to be similar to how a design hand-off might occur for a new page on our site.

1) Open `code/index.html` and `code/index.css` in a text editor. The basic scaffolding of the page should already be in place.
2) Your task if to create the page shown in the designs using html and css.

### Source Files

We've included a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/976605049059131489), [Photoshop PSD](https://github.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/raw/master/designs/page.psd), a [JPG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/master/designs/page.jpg), and a [JPG with guidelines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/master/designs/page-guidelines.jpg) to help you build out the page.

### Requirements
* Try to be as close as possible to the existing design matching the padding, margins and font-sizing specified in the designs.
* Try to correctly add shadows and gradients wherever they are included in the designs.
* If you can, use the exact colors specified in the designs.

### Notes
* If you need to copy and paste text content, you can find it all in [`copy.txt`](https://github.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/blob/master/copy.txt)
* Ignore browser compatibility—use whatever css techniques you think best accomplish the designs
* Image assets are already included [in this folder](https://github.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/tree/master/code/images)
* A basic `container` element is included to speed up design and fonts have already been included

### Bonus Requirements
If you have extra time after completing the basic challenge you can also complete these additional tasks:
* Make the page responsive for tablet and mobile
* Add a subtle but interesting (like you might do for a real build) hover style for cards when they are moused over
